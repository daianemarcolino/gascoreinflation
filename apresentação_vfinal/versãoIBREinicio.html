### A história do núcleo da inflação

- **1978:** Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) começa a divulgar o índice *CPI all items less food and energy*
--

- **2001:** *CPI all items less food and energy* é classificado como uma medida de núcleo

--


Alguns exemplos de núcleos:
--

- **1991: Bryan &amp; Pike** - inflação via mediana
--

- **1994: Bryan &amp; Cecchetti** - inflação via mediana ponderada e médias aparadas
--

- **1994: Dow** - inflação via dupla ponderação
- **1995: Diewert** - inflação via dupla ponderação
--

- **1995: Quah &amp; Vahey** - VAR bivariado entre uma medida de produto e a inflação
--

- **2002: Cogley** - núcleo via modelo de suavização exponencial
--

- **2002: Cristadoro et al** - modelo de fator dinâmico generalizado
- **2015: Stock &amp; Watson** - modelo de fator dinâmico com volatilidade estocástica

### A história do núcleo da inflação

Algumas análises, críticas e contribuições encontradas em Wynne (1999), Clark (2001), Rich &amp; Steindel (2005) e em Wynne (2008):
--


**1. Critérios de Avaliação**
--

- *Estimação em tempo real*
--

- *Entendimento pelo público*
--

- *Base teórica*
--

- *Similaridade de médias*
--

- *Acompanhar a tendência da inflação*
--

- *Trajetória explicativa*

--


**2. Cautela na Utilização**
--


**3. Medida de meta intermediária na política monetária**

### Conclusão

**1.** Os núcleos não aderem por completo aos critérios sugeridos (alta volatilidade, sazonalidade)

**2.** O núcleo por médias aparadas traz mais informação sobre o desenvolvimento futuro da inflação (curto-prazo)

## 3. Propostas metodológicas

--

**1. Suavização dos núcleos tradicionais: Núcleo-S**

**2. Núcleo via *Dynamic Conditional Score Models*: Núcleo-DCS**

class: noinverse, middle

### 1. Suavização dos núcleos tradicionais: Núcleo-S

Procedimentos para o aprimoramento de um núcleo por médias aparadas:

1. Alterar a proporção de itens que serão removidos;

2. Remover a sazonalidade;

3. Remoção da alta frequência residual.

###  2. Núcleo via *DCS Models*: Núcleo-DCS

*Dynamic Conditional Score Models* (modelos DCS)

Também conhecido como:

- *Generalized Autoregressive Score models* (modelos GAS).
- *Score Driven models*.


Pertencem à classe de modelos guiados por observações.

Principais referências:

- Crea et al (2013) e Harvey (2013).
- Muitas aplicações em modelagem de risco de crédito, volatilidade de ações, dados de alta frequência.

###  Modelo DCS

Considere:

- `\(\large{y_t}\)` o vetor que representa a variável dependente
- `\(\large{f_t}\)` o vetor de parâmetros que variam no tempo
- `\(\large{x_t}\)` o vetor de covariáveis
- `\(\large{\theta}\)` o vetor de parâmetros estáticos 

Defina:

- `\(\large{Y^t = \{y_1,...,y_t\}}\)`
- `\(\large{F^t = \{f_0,f_1,...,f_t\}}\)`
- `\(\large{X^t = \{x_1,...,x_t\}}\)`

tem-se que o conjunto de informações disponíveis até o tempo `\(\large{t}\)` consiste em `\(\large\{f_t,\mathcal{F}_t\}\)`, em que: 

`$$\large{\mathcal{F}_t = \{Y^{t-1}, F^{t-1}, X^{t}\}, \text{ para } t = 1,...,T}$$`

class: noinverse

###  Modelo DCS

Assume-se que

### Modelo DCS

**Diagnósticos:** &lt;br&gt; com base nos resíduos quantílicos do modelo (Kalliovirta, 2009). 

&lt;!-- - Kalliovirta (2009) mostrou que a análise dos resíduos tradicionais (resíduos de Pearson) pode levar a inferências erradas. --&gt;
&lt;!-- - a autora propôe o uso dos resíduos quantílicos --&gt;
&lt;!-- - os resíduos quantílicos podem ser definidos para qualquer modelo baseado em uma distribuição contínua. --&gt;

Os resíduos quantílicos:

`$$\large{r_{t,\hat{\theta}} = \Phi^{-1}\left ( F(y_t|f_t,\mathcal{F}_t;\hat{\theta}) \right )}$$`

em que `\(\large{\Phi^{-1}(\cdot)}\)` é a inversa da distribuição Normal e `\(\large{F(y_t|f_t,\mathcal{F}_t;\theta)}\)` é a função de distribuição acumulada condicional de `\(\large{y_t}\)`.

Diagnósticos:

- teste de normalidade: Jarque-Bera (1987)
- teste de autocorrelação e heterocedasticidade: Ljung-Box (1978)

**Previsão:** a previsão 1 passo à frente é dada diretamente pelo modelo. Para mais passos à frente, utiliza-se o método de simulação de Monte Carlo.

&lt;!-- 1. Considere `\(\large{f_t}\)`, `\(\large{s_t}\)` e as estimativas de máxima verossimilhança de `\(\large{\theta}\)`. --&gt;

&lt;!-- 2. Para cada `\(\large{k = 1,...,K}\)` serão geradas `\(\large{m}\)` trajetórias independentes: --&gt;

&lt;!--     (a) simule um valor para `\(\large{y_{t+k}}\)` considerando a distribuição preditiva do modelo dadas as estimativas de `\(\large{\theta}\)` e os conjuntos de informação `\(\large{f_{t+k-1}}\)` e `\(\large{s_{t+k-1}}\)` --&gt;

&lt;!--     (b) atualize `\(\large{f_{t+k}}\)` e `\(\large{s_{t+k}}\)` --&gt;

&lt;!--     (c) retorne ao passo (a) até que `\(\large{k = K}\)` --&gt;

&lt;!-- 3. A previsão final `\(\large{\hat{y}_{t+k|t}}\)` será obtida via média das `\(\large{m}\)` trajetórias simuladas para o passo `\(\large{k}\)`. O intervalo de confiança de `\(\large{100(1-\alpha)\%}\)` pode ser definido pelos quantis de ordem `\(\large{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\)` e `\(\large{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}}\)` destas mesmas trajetórias. --&gt;

### Inflação 2018

No ano:
- IPC-Br: 4,36%
- IPCA: 4,69%
- Núcleo-DCS: 4,91%, IC 95%: [3,96 - 6,39]

&lt;!-- ### 5. Considerações finais e trabalhos futuros --&gt;

**1.** Núcleos da inflação são uma das ferramentas usadas pelos bancos centrais como suporte na condução da política monetária.

**2.** Existem várias formas de se estimar um núcleo.

**3.** No Brasil, os núcleos não trazem grande informação sobre a tendência dos preços.

**4.** Por isso, propõem-se dois novos núcleos: Núcleo-S e o Núcleo-DCS.

**5.** Ambas as propostas oferecem informação mais clara a respeito da tendência da inflação e seus possíveis movimentos futuros.

**6.** Recomenda-se o uso do Núcleo-DCS pois em sua construção não é influenciado por tantas observações passadas como o Núcleo-S.

**7.** O Núcleo-DCS pode auxiliar no controle da inflação acumulada no ano.

**8.** Trabalhos futuros: iniciar a divulgação do Núcleo-DCS através da FGV IBRE; estimar o núcleo diretamente para o IPCA; estimar modelos econométricos para avaliar o impacto da utilização do núcleo na previsão.
